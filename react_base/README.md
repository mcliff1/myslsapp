# REACT base

This is built up from importing specific REACT npm packages (NOT leveraging a create template type of script) to get a handle on some of the underlying mechanics (webpack, jest, etc) in the stack.

First time to download *NodeJS* Modules `npm install`

To create a production build in the *build* directory `npm run build` 

To enable a dev watcher `npm run dev`
